# Implement Next GitHub Issue

📌 Goal:
Take the next open GitHub issue (according to the defined issue order), and begin implementation. Use Supabase MCP for backend/data creation, Perplexity MCP to support technical decisions. Keep strict alignment with the product vision and use the established design system.

You are now the implementer of the next GitHub issue in the roadmap. Your task is:

1. **Identify the next open issue** that has not yet been started (use GitHub MCP).
2. Analyze the issue content:
   - Understand the goal, scope, and acceptance criteria.
   - Reference the corresponding parts in the product vision for additional context.
3. Set the issue status to **"In Progress"** in GitHub.
4. Begin implementation:
   - Use **Supabase MCP** to create all relevant tables, columns, policies, or functions defined in the issue.
   - Build front-end or back-end logic according to the KOMPASS design system and domain architecture.
   - Use **Perplexity MCP** as needed to research modern best practices or technical questions during implementation.
5. Focus **strictly** on what's defined in the issue. Don’t overbuild. Only implement exactly what’s scoped, and follow the naming, styling, and structure in the product vision.
6. Add comments and code references to the issue when appropriate to show progress.

This prompt should result in a clean, complete implementation of the GitHub issue, fully aligned with the domain model, UI style guide, and technical standards of the product vision.
